# mother-daughter-blog

This is a project I use for the class I teach at Codetalk. One of the first assignments Requirements is to build a blog using HTML and CSS. They are requirements to have 2 cta's, 2 hex colors, 2 images, and 1 background image and use 2 fonts from google fonts. They are working in groups of two. They act as each other's clients. They must use the fonts, colors and the topic that their client chooses.
